# Alien Axolotl Origin - Origins (Fabric) For Minecraft 1.18
When developing this Origin, I tired to use a [Multiple (Power Type)](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types/power_types/multiple) but unfortunatly it did not work so now its just a mess really. But it works perfectly fine, the code is just a mess to look at.

Alien Axolotl datapack is made for the fabric mod, [Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins). You must have it for this pack to work. This datapack also uses the [Pehkui](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pehkui) mod which you must have to get the designed player height.

**This Pack Adds:**
- Custom Origin
